ninety_weather _LongVibe
==============

Based on 91 Weather with small modification:
if the connection to a phone is lost it will give two very long vibes
instead of a very short vibe in the original "91 Weather".
Also it will check for connection every minute instead of every two minutes.
This mod tries to address a problem of you forgetting the phone or you phone being stolen.
